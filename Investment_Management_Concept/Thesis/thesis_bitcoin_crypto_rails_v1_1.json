Bitcoin is positioned as digital hard money with a fixed supply cap and decentralized security, enabling permissionless global settlement and serving as the core long-duration asset in the thesis. In parallel, a capped alt-crypto sleeve (primarily Ethereum and major L2s) provides exposure to programmable settlement and DeFi primitives, with stablecoins as the practical on-chain payments rail. The portfolio posture is Bitcoin-first (core) with selective, risk-managed exposure to crypto infrastructure where adoption and on-chain liquidity are durable. Adds are driven by regime persistence and improving adoption/institutional access rather than short-term price momentum. Trims or exit decisions are triggered by valuation extremes, structural breaks in network security/investability, or sustained degradation of adoption/rail health.",
