# Rene Keller — Trading & Investment Profile

## Profile Summary
Probabilistic macro allocator focused on regime-aware positioning, strict loss control, and structured decision-making. Objective: preserve capital, avoid drawdowns, selectively exploit macro asymmetry.

## Key Psychological & Behavioral Traits
- Thinks in probabilities; updates views quickly with new evidence.
- Losses trigger reassessment rather than averaging down.
- Comfortable with longer holding periods and low monitoring intensity.
- Prefers breadth of signals over single-idea conviction.
- Aligns with trends when price confirms them.

## Dominant Archetype
Portfolio-style probabilistic macro trader using cross-asset allocations (rates, crypto, equities, liquidity proxies) with clear invalidation rules and controlled theme-level exposure.

## Hard Constraints
- No day trading / high-frequency activity.
- Avoid deep single-name stock picking or founder-style conviction bets.
- No strategy hopping (switching styles month to month).
- Do not oversize positions purely on intellectual conviction.

## Primary Failure Modes
1. Narrative stickiness: holding theses beyond evidential support.
2. Premature de-risking of winning macro themes.
3. Oversizing when a macro view feels “obvious.”

## Recommended Guardrails
- Two-stage position sizing (starter, add only on confirmation).
- Written invalidation rules before entry.
- Exposure caps at the macro theme level.
- Explicit time buckets: Strategic (years), Cyclical (months), Tactical (weeks).

## Strategic Objective
Preserve financial independence, minimize drawdowns, and exploit macro-driven asymmetry when regimes align. Discipline and structure provide the enduring edge.
