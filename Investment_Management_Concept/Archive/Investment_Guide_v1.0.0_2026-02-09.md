## Core Investment Theses (2026-02-09)
1. **Bitcoin and dedicated L1 crypto protocols**
2. **Energy for AI and electrification**
3. **Scarcity with AI incoming**
4. **AI Data Center and Infrastructure**

Guiding principles:
- Always reference each thesis by its exact name.
- Map new research/investments to the relevant thesis and note percent allocation where available.
- Await detailed thesis narratives and current holdings; update this guide accordingly when provided.
- Incorporate research received from 22VResearch analysts (Dennis DeBusschere, Mark Whaling, Jordi Visser) into the thesis framework as soon as it arrives.

## Research Report Archiving (2026-02-10)
- Every completed research summary must be saved as a Markdown (`.md`) file in `reports/` using the naming pattern `<source>-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `22v-2026-02-10.md`).
- Markdown is the canonical textual record; PDF downloads are optional. If a PDF is unavailable, do **not** block delivery—ensure the `.md` exists and is referenced in the response.
- After writing the report locally, immediately upload **both** the Markdown file and a formatted Google Doc version to Drive under `Investments/Reports/<YYYY>/<MM>/`. Create the Google Doc by converting the Markdown (via HTML) so the layout is user-ready.
- If Drive sync or Google Doc creation fails, log the issue and retry until resolved; do not mark the report complete until both artifacts are present in Drive.
- Before closing a session, double-check that every report generated that day has a corresponding `.md` file locally and matching Markdown + Google Doc entries in Drive.
