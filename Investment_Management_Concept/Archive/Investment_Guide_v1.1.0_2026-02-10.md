Version: 1.1.0
Last Updated: 2026-02-10

## Core Investment Theses (2026-02-09)
1. **Bitcoin and dedicated L1 crypto protocols**
2. **Energy for AI and electrification**
3. **Scarcity with AI incoming**
4. **AI Data Center and Infrastructure**

Guiding principles:
- Always reference each thesis by its exact name.
- Map new research/investments to the relevant thesis and note percent allocation where available.
- Await detailed thesis narratives and current holdings; update this guide accordingly when provided.
- Incorporate research received from 22VResearch analysts (Dennis DeBusschere, Mark Whaling, Jordi Visser) into the thesis framework as soon as it arrives.

## Research Report Archiving (Versioned 2026-02-10)
- Draft summaries locally only as a temporary staging step. As soon as the Markdown (`.md`) and Google Doc versions are uploaded to Drive (`Investments/Reports/<YYYY>/<MM>/`), delete the local copies to prevent duplication between the workspace and Drive.
- Naming: `<source>-YYYY-MM-DD.md` for Markdown and `Source - YYYY-MM-DD Summary (Doc)` for the Google Doc. Store both in the same monthly folder.
- Conversion flow: Markdown → HTML (for formatting) → Google Doc upload via Drive API to ensure presentation-quality output. PDFs remain optional.
- Treat Drive as the canonical repository. Local files should only exist while editing; confirm removal at the end of each session.
- Log and resolve any Drive or Doc upload failures immediately; do not consider a report complete until both artifacts are present in Drive.

## Versioning & Archives (Versioned 2026-02-10)
- Every instruction/template must declare `Version` and `Last Updated` at the top. Bump the version and date with each modification.
- Maintain active instruction files in `Investments/Guides/`. When a new version is published, move the previous version into `Investments/Archive/` with a filename that encodes the version and date (e.g., `Investment_Guide_v1.0.0_2026-02-09.md`).
- Keep only the latest instruction in the working directory for reference; the canonical copy lives in Drive.
