The core edge is discipline: insist on dividend sustainability (coverage), balance-sheet strength, and management commitment to capital returns. Use valuation-aware adds (relative yield vs history) and systematic quality screens to avoid dividend traps. The thesis aims to deliver resilient total returns with meaningful cash yield, lower drawdowns than broad equities, and the ability to reinvest dividends through downturns.",
