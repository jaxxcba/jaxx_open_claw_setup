# Guides

## Active

`active/` contains only current, normative guidance:

- `investment_methodology.md` (governance and operating model)
- `operator_quickstart.md` (execution runbook)

## Phase 1 lock

During Phase 1, these are the only allowed files in `active/`:

- `investment_methodology.md`
- `operator_quickstart.md`
- `research_sources_reference.json`

Any additional active file must be treated as a violation until Phase 1 is formally closed.

## Phase 2 lean archive

`archive/` is created when superseded guide versions exist. It follows a lean policy:

- keep one canonical file per version,
- remove duplicate import variants,
- remove unversioned throwaway copies,
- maintain an `archive/README.md` index once archive content is created.

## Rule

Do not add a third active governance document unless there is a clear non-overlapping responsibility and Phase 1 lock has been explicitly lifted.
