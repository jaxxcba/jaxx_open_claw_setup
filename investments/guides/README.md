# Guides

## Active

`active/` contains only current, normative guidance:

- `investment_methodology.md` (governance and operating model)
- `operator_quickstart.md` (execution runbook)

## Phase 1 lock

During Phase 1, these are the only allowed files in `active/`:

- `investment_methodology.md`
- `operator_quickstart.md`
- `research_sources_reference.json`

Any additional active file must be treated as a violation until Phase 1 is formally closed.

## Archive

`archive/` contains superseded guidance retained for historical reference.

## Rule

Do not add a third active governance document unless there is a clear non-overlapping responsibility and Phase 1 lock has been explicitly lifted.
