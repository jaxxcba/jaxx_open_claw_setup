# OpenClaw Installation Legacy Notes

Status: Active
Last Updated: 2026-02-18

## Purpose

This folder keeps historical installation-era artifacts that are specific to early OpenClaw setup.

It is not the canonical home for investment use-case guides.

## Canonical ownership

Investment workflow and guide documents are canonically owned in:

- `/workspace/jaxx_open_claw_setup/investments/guides/archive/open_claw_architecture_v_1_5_2.md`
- `/workspace/jaxx_open_claw_setup/investments/guides/archive/open_claw_user_guide_v_1_2.md`
- `/workspace/jaxx_open_claw_setup/investments/guides/archive/openclaw_openrouter_presets_configuration_v_1_1.md`

## Retained artifact in this folder

- `# JAXX — Operating Constitution (v1.0).md` (historical operating constitution snapshot from first installation)

## Rule

Do not duplicate investment guidance files in this folder.
Use the canonical files in `investments/guides/` and link instead of copying.
