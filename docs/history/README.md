# JAXX Docs History

Version: 1.1.0
Last Updated: 2026-02-18
Status: Active

## Purpose

This folder is a low-priority historical record.
It is optional for daily operation.

Use this folder only when you need:
- traceability of prior migration and simplification work,
- context for why an old structure changed,
- audit support for completed one-off tasks.

## Lightweight usage rule

Default path for normal work:
1. `README.md`
2. `docs/index.md`
3. `docs/conventions.md`
4. `docs/operator_playbook.md`

Only open `docs/history/` if you are investigating prior decisions.

## What belongs here

- completed plans,
- execution reports,
- one-time audits,
- no longer normative implementation notes.

## References

- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/conventions.md`
