## Phase outcomes

- Phase 1: moved non-normative process artifacts into `docs/history/`.
- Phase 2: added operator playbook and reduced onboarding friction.
- Phase 3: consolidated overlapping governance guidance.
- Phase 4: applied metadata and secrets hardening checks.

## Detailed records

- `step2_move_plan.md`
- `step2_execution_report.md`
